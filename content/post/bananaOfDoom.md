# About Playroom

I've been using **Playroom**, a multiplayer service by <a href="https://www.littleumbrella.gg/" target="_blank">Little Umbrella</a>, for the past year to develop various multiplayer features in my jam games.
It facilitates the creation of rooms for various clients to connect to and the API can be used in various game engines or web frameworks.

So, when they announced an opening, I jumped at the opportunity and was lucky enough to land an internship with them.

# About the game

In **Banana of Doom**, the AI judge gives you a prompt, and you must combine words from different genres to craft the most hilarious answer. Your responses are then judged by the AI, and the player with the highest score at the end wins. Get ready for a fast-paced, laugh-out-loud party game!

# My Role

Some of my responsabilities include the developement and implementation of new game features such as the **Lobby Minigame**, the **Cards Binder** or a brand new **Single Player Gamemode** to play the game alone.
