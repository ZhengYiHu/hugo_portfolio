In **Banana of Doom**, the AI judge gives you a prompt, and you must combine words from different genres to craft the most hilarious answer. Your responses are then judged by the AI, and the player with the highest score at the end wins. Get ready for a fast-paced, laugh-out-loud party game!

# My Contributions

My responsibilities included the development and implementation of UI designs, card collection systems such as Cards Binder and new Game Modes, as well as various Discord-specific integrations to synchronize purchased items across all devices.

## Card Collection
When I joined the project, the game was moving toward a TCG model with booster packs and card collection. My contributions primarily focused on implementing the card collection system, from pack opening to binder management.

# About Playroom

I've been using **Playroom**, a multiplayer service by <a href="https://www.littleumbrella.gg/" target="_blank">Little Umbrella</a>, for the past year to develop various multiplayer features in my jam games.
It facilitates the creation of rooms for various clients to connect to and the API can be used in various game engines or web frameworks.

So, when they announced an opening, I jumped at the opportunity and was lucky enough to land an internship with them.
