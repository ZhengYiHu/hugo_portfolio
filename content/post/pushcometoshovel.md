# My Role: Lead Programmer

As the **Lead Programmer**, I was responsible for overseeing the programming team by assigning tasks based on each member’s strengths and ensuring clear communication between departments. I worked closely with designers, artists, and writers to align technical requirements with the creative vision of the project.

On the development side, I built and maintained key systems that formed the backbone of the game, including the **dialogue system**, **quest system**, and **save/load** functionality. To streamline development, I also created user-friendly interfaces and tools that allowed non-programmers to easily implement content without needing to touch code.
