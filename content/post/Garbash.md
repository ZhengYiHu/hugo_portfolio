# About the game

In Lillapad, you play as Lilla, a young girl who’s been transformed into a tadpole by King Frog, only to discover she has the unexpected ability to switch between tadpole and frog forms at will.

# My Role: Sole Programmer

I was the sole programmer on this project, responsible for building all gameplay systems, mechanics, and UI using Unreal Engine’s Blueprint visual scripting.

My main focus was creating Blueprints that were easy to use and flexible, so the level designer could build and tweak levels without worrying about the technical side. I wanted to make sure they could stay in the flow of designing without needing to touch any code, which helped speed things up and kept our workflow smooth.

I also kept everything well-organized and clearly documented, so anyone (or myself :p) could jump in later and understand, edit, or expand the Blueprints without getting lost.

# Game mechanics

## Frog Interactions
Frog Interactions
As a frog, you can use your tongue to interact with a variety of objects—each with its own unique response:

- Vines let you grapple onto them and swing across gaps.

- Rocks can be picked up and carried to solve puzzles or clear paths.

- Lotus heads feed you a seed, which you can shoot at certain objects to activate or destroy them.

## Tadpole Interactions
As a tadpole, you're light and agile, allowing you to interact with the environment in unique ways:

- Dive underwater to swim through tight passages.

- Push lily pads to reposition them for platforming or puzzles.

- Leap higher when jumping out of water.

- Squeeze into small spaces that the frog form can’t access.
